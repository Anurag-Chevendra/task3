## About
You have been given a PE (Portable Executable) file named `figure_this_out_pt2.exe`. This file appears to encode an input string. Your task is to reverse engineer the executable to determine what the original input string was, given the encoded output.

The encoded output string provided is: `WPUbutof1xJj+U%nVB"L`

## Objectives
Use a decompiler of your choice and start analysing the pseudo code. Difficiculty is beginner level hence there are no hints provided. I prefer [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) as a decompiler, but you can install any (Ghidra etc). Also, [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWSa1L5L394) might be useful just for starters. **Your objective is to analyze the executable file to understand the encoding algorithm used and then write a program or script to decode the provided output string in python. Then figure out what the input to `figure_this_out_pt2.exe` was so as to obtain `WPUbutof1xJj+U%nVB"L` as the output**. All the best!
### Reverse Engineering
Analyze the `figure_this_out_pt2.exe` file, disassemble the code, and explore the assembly instructions and high-level language representations. By examining the code, identify the relevant functions, calculations, and operations that contribute to the output generation.
## How to go about
open cmd

##TL;DR
what is the input to this exe such that the output is  `WPUbutof1xJj+U%nVB"L`
step 1: mkdir task2

step 2: cd task2

step 3: git clone [https://github.com/Anurag-Chevendra/task3.git](https://github.com/Anurag-Chevendra/task3.git)
